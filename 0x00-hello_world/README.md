#### This is my ALX_SE project on learning C. This file explains what the scripts and programs do.
_____________________________________________________________________________________________

0-preprocessor runs a C file through the preprocessor and save the result into another file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE and the output will be saved in the file c

1-compiler compiles a C file but does not link. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE and the output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .o instead of .c.

2-assembler generates the assembly code of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE and the output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

3-name compiles a C file and creates an executable named cisfun. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE

4-puts.c is a C program that prints exactly _"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle_, followed by a new line. 

5-printf.c is a C program that prints exactly _with proper grammar, but the outcome is a piece of art,_, followed by a new line. 

6-size.c is a C program that prints the size of various types on the computer it is compiled and run on. 

100-intel generates the assembly code (Intel syntax) of a C code and save it in an output file. The C file name will be saved in the variable $CFILE and the output file will be named the same as the C file, but with the extension .s instead of .c.

101-quote.c is a C program that prints exactly _and that piece of art is useful" - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19_, followed by a new line, to the standard error.
